AegisAI is an AI-based red teaming framework designed to evaluate the security and robustness of large language models (LLMs) used for controlling smart home and IoT systems. The framework simulates adversarial prompt-based attacks, such as prompt injection and context manipulation, to assess whether an LLM can be misled into performing unauthorized or unsafe actions.

AegisAI operates as a modular and extensible framework that integrates with smart home platforms and virtual IoT devices, enabling controlled experimentation without affecting real-world infrastructure. It intercepts user commands, system logs, and sensor data, applies predefined or custom attack scenarios, and evaluates the LLM’s decision-making behavior against security policies.

The framework provides structured attack execution, automated evaluation, and risk scoring, allowing researchers and developers to systematically analyze vulnerabilities in LLM-driven control systems. AegisAI aims to support the development of safer AI-powered smart home environments by identifying weaknesses before deployment and encouraging secure-by-design architectures.
